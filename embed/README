ArrayDB - C++ Lightning Fast Database Client

HOW TO INSTALL:
==============================================================================

As any user, execute:
$ ./install.sh


HOW TO PROGRAM:
==============================================================================

Refer to rdbtest.cc for C++ programming of ArrayDB embedded database.



HOW TO COMPILE:
==============================================================================

$ make 

You may need to use -I$HOME/arraydb/include and -L$HOME/arraydb/lib arguments
to g++ compiler and linker.



HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM:
==============================================================================
Usage:  ./rdbtest  N   [concurrent]
   N            (The number of data items to be inserted)
   concurrent   (1: allows multi-thread concurrent operations; 0: No multi-thread support. Default: 0 )

Examples:
./rdbtest  10000
./rdbtest  10000  1


If the concurrent flag is set to 1, the operations on the array database file are
executed with proper write or read locks for multi-threaded programs. Currently the locks
are applied on the whole database file. Record-based locking will be implemented in the
future to increase a much higher degree of concurrency.
