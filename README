Jaguar -- next generation big data platform for enterprises

Jaguar is a scalable, fast analytical platform for big data. It uses an 
innovative array-indexing technology in data access path. Compared to traditional 
B+Tree in relational database software, Jaguar employs plain arrays in data indexing.
Arrays have excellent data locality, read-ahead, and caching properties. The core
storage and indexing engine is 10X - 50X faster than B+Tree, therefore table join 
and range search operations are extremely fast.

Jaguar uses the simplest data model: array. All data items are placed in a huge
flat array sorted by its primary keys. Also secondary-indexes are maintained as data 
is updated in the data array. The indexes are also stored in arrays.

Even in a complex distributed enviroment, data is still logically presented as an array
to the user. From the perspective of users or programmers, a table is just an array of
sorted data items, and so is an index. Physically the table is striped over a number of
hosts in the cluster. No other data platforms can allow programmers to directly access 
the underlying data structure. Jaguar offers an extremely powerful platform to conduct
map-reduce as well as non-mapreduce tasks over large amount of data that are sorted,
indexed, stored over hundreds or even thousands of computer hosts.
