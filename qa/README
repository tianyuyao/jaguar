This directory is for QA test.

After we successfully downloaded and install a jaguar build. we can run this test as an acceptance test, which covers most 
of the basic sql syntax.

Note:  please copy the data folder jaguarTestData into the home directory $HOME, so the 
arraydbFunc.sq will load data properly.

On the command line, run: "./arraydbMainFunc.sh", you will get a log file with a time stamp attached after the test. 
The log file's format looks like this: "arraydbFunc_sql_20150828_130915.log"
