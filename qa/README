This directory is for QA test.

After we successfully downloaded and install a jaguar build, we can run this test
as an acceptance test, which covers most of the basic sql syntax.

Note:  
1) Please copy the data folder jaguarTestData into the your home directory $HOME, so the 
arraydbFunc.sq will load data properly. For example, make sure to see this:

(azhang@vmlxU2)\>ls -l $HOME/jaguarTestData/10kLine.txt
-rwxr-xr-x 1 azhang azhang 680353 Aug 16 02:23 /home/azhang/jaguarTestData/10kLine.txt

2) On the command line, run: "./arraydbMainFunc.sh", after test, you will see  
a log file with a time stamp attached like this one: 
"arraydbFunc_sql_20150828_130915.log"
